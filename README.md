- A planets surface is automatically generated by perlin noise.

## How to compile/run the game:
You don't need to download any libraries(isn't that great?)!

You can compile it however you want. I personally use eclipse to do that, but the project should be compatible with other ways to compile it.

To run it you can either use your IDE or execute the main class(Main.java).

The other graphics were made by me or are from the public domain.

I also wrote all the code, but that may change.
